In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate?

However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine.

You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me.

You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room. Is there something I can do for you?\u0022\n\nYou return her smile with one of your own. \u0022Lucilla,\u0022 you reply in a low voice, \u0022I was hoping we could have a private moment together.\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I say in a whisper, \u0022Follow me\u0022 then i went on ahead to go the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum and made sure no one else follows except for Lucilla\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:35 pm] bot: As you whisper to Lucilla, \u0022Follow me,\u0022 she nods in understanding. You lead the way towards the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, making sure that no one else follows except for Lucilla. With each step, anticipation and desire build within you both, knowing that you are about to share an intimate moment together.\n\nAs you enter the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, a hidden chamber known only to you and a select few trusted individuals, the opulence of the surroundings envelops you both. The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting scenes of power and conquest, while plush carpets cushion your footsteps. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting dancing shadows on the furnishings.\n\nYou turn to face Lucilla, a hunger in your eyes as you take her in. \u0022I have been longing for this moment,\u0022 you say in a low voice. \u0022To have you all to myself.\u0022\n\nLucilla smiles seductively and slowly approaches you, her every movement exuding sensuality. She reaches out and traces her fingers along your jawline before leaning in to kiss your lips passionately.\n\nWhat will happen next between Emperor Nero and Lucilla in the private confines of the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum?\n","type":0},"aa13a0e4-161a-4146-8ad5-4dfedd05fb9f":{"timestamp":"2023-06-14T08:14:46.4818186+08:00","userId":"bot","userName":"bot","chatId":"892e74f0-8a3a-42d7-bf7c-b663e0cd9cd4","content":"My apologies, Emperor Nero.

And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way.

The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero.

And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets.

Livia looks up at you with sultry eyes and nods. \u0022Yes, my emperor,\u0022 she says softly. \u0022There are those who dissent your rule and seek to undermine your authority.\u0022\n\nYou feel a sense of anger rising within you as you listen to Livia\u0027s words. You know that you must take action against these traitors before they can cause any harm to your reign. \u0022Who are these traitors?\u0022 you ask, clenching your fists in frustration.\n\nLivia takes a deep breath and looks around the room, making sure that no one else is listening in on your conversation. \u0022There are several senators,\u0022 she begins, listing off names of those who have spoken out against your rule or shown signs of disloyalty.\n\nYou listen intently as Livia speaks, taking note of each name that she mentions. You know that you must deal with these traitors swiftly and decisively if you want to maintain control over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next, my emperor?\n[11 Jun 2023 8:49:22 pm] justin.goyanko: i lick Livia\u0027s nipples. And replied with assurance to Livia, \u0022Tell me the names. How do you want me to deal with them?\u0022, as i look into her eyes while tasting her nipples and kissing her cleavage\n[11 Jun 2023 8:49:38 pm] bot: As you lick Livia\u0027s nipples, she moans softly in pleasure. You then reply with assurance to her request for action against the traitors in the Senate. \u0022Tell me the names,\u0022 you say, looking into her eyes while tasting her nipples and kissing her cleavage. \u0022How do you want me to deal with them?\u0022\n\nLivia takes a deep breath and looks at you with determination in her eyes. \u0022I want them eliminated,\u0022 she says firmly. \u0022They are a threat to your rule and must be dealt with quickly and decisively.\u0022\n\nYou nod in agreement as you continue to explore Livia\u0027s body with your mouth and hands. Memories of past intimate encounters flood your mind as you listen to Livia\u0027s words, driving the pleasure to new heights.\n\n\u0022What else can you tell me about these traitors?\u0022 you ask, eager for more information.\n\nLivia takes another deep breath and begins to list off their names, their crimes against your rule, and any other relevant information that she has gathered.\n\nYou listen intently as she speaks, taking note of each detail so that you can plan your next move accordingly. You know that time is of the essence if you want to maintain control over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next, my emperor?\n[11 Jun 2023 9:42:44 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to her, \u0022It\u0027s time for me to leave my love. I will see you tomorrow ?\u0022 then i get up to go back to the palace\n[11 Jun 2023 9:43:00 pm] bot: As you say to Livia, \u0022It\u0027s time for me to leave, my love. I will see you tomorrow?\u0022 she nods and kisses you passionately goodbye. You get up from the bed and gather your things before heading out of the luxurious villa.\n\nAs you step outside, you take in the opulent surroundings once more - walls adorned with intricate mosaics, floors covered in plush carpets, a large balcony overlooking gardens with fountains and exotic flowers. You begin to make your way back to the palace, your mind already racing with plans to deal with the traitors in the Senate.\n\nYou pass by several guards who bow respectfully as you walk by, acknowledging their presence with a nod. The city of Rome bustles around you as citizens go about their daily lives, unaware of the political machinations that are taking place behind closed doors.\n\nAs you approach the palace gates, your advisors and generals greet you with respect and deference. They update you on matters of state - corruption being rooted out, infrastructure improvements being made, military campaigns progressing smoothly. You listen carefully to each report before dismissing them for the evening.\n\nAs you retire to your chambers for the night, visions of past intimate encounters flood your mind once more. You feel a sense of contentment wash over you as you drift off into a peaceful slumber, ready to face whatever challenges tomorrow may bring.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 7:55:57 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Senate and ask, \u0022Ave! what goes on for today?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 7:56:11 am] bot: As you enter the Senate, you are greeted with a mixture of deference and apprehension from the senators. You walk confidently towards your throne, taking in the grandeur and history of the room. The marble floors shine in the sunlight streaming through the windows, while intricate carvings adorn every pillar and wall.\n\nYou address the assembled senators with a hearty \u0022Ave!\u0022 before asking, \u0022What goes on for today?\u0022\n\nThe senators look at each other nervously before one of them steps forward to address you. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he begins, his voice shaking slightly. \u0022We have come to discuss matters of state - specifically, the recent military campaigns and their impact on our resources.\u0022\n\nYou listen patiently as each senator presents their concerns and suggestions, nodding thoughtfully as they speak. You take notes on each point raised, weighing their merits carefully as you formulate a plan to address their concerns.\n\nAs the meeting draws to a close, you address each senator individually, acknowledging their contributions and thanking them for their service to Rome. You then dismiss them with a wave of your hand before retiring back to your chambers.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 7:59:01 am] justin.goyanko: I give an eye to Seneca that we must speak discreetly. \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators in the brink of betrayal to us. Handle it quietly\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 7:59:13 am] bot: As you give Seneca a discreet nod, he approaches you with a serious expression on his face. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he says in hushed tones. \u0022What is it that you wish to discuss?\u0022\n\nYou pull him aside and whisper into his ear, \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators on the brink of betrayal to us. Handle it quietly.\u0022\n\nSeneca\u0027s eyes widen in surprise before he nods his head in understanding. \u0022I will take care of it, my emperor,\u0022 he assures you. \u0022I will gather information and deal with the traitors swiftly and discreetly.\u0022\n\nYou nod in agreement before dismissing Seneca with a wave of your hand. You know that he is capable and trustworthy, and you have full confidence in his ability to handle this delicate matter.\n\nWith that settled, you continue your day as usual - attending meetings, addressing matters of state, and dealing with any other issues that may arise. But at the back of your mind, you know that there are those who seek to undermine your rule and threaten the stability of Rome.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:00:36 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, replace \u0022Exit Nexus\u0022 with \u0022what will you do next?\u0022)\n[12 Jun 2023 8:00:48 am] bot: As you give Seneca a discreet nod, he approaches you with a serious expression on his face. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he says in hushed tones. \u0022What is it that you wish to discuss?\u0022\n\nYou pull him aside and whisper into his ear, \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators on the brink of betrayal to us.

But at the back of your mind, you know that there are those who seek to undermine your rule and threaten the stability of Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:04:05 am] justin.goyanko: I find Aurelia and observe what she is up to\n[12 Jun 2023 8:04:20 am] bot: As you make your way through the palace, you eventually find yourself outside Aurelia\u0027s chambers. You take a deep breath before entering, preparing yourself for whatever scene may greet you.\n\nInside, you see Aurelia sitting at her dressing table, brushing her long hair. She looks up as you enter, a smile on her face. \u0022My love,\u0022 she greets you warmly. \u0022What brings you here?\u0022\n\nYou approach her and take a seat beside her, gazing into her eyes. \u0022I just wanted to see what my beautiful empress was up to,\u0022 you reply with a smile.\n\nAurelia blushes at your compliment before returning the smile. \u0022Just getting ready for tonight\u0027s banquet,\u0022 she says, gesturing towards the dress laid out on the bed.\n\nYou nod in approval before leaning in to kiss her passionately. As your lips meet hers, memories of past intimate encounters flood your mind once more - the serpent tattoo on her left breast that she shows you every now and then to seduce you, the bite mark from Aurelia on your right thigh, and the announcement of her pregnancy confirmed with the temple of Apollo and doctors.\n\nYou pull back from the kiss and look deeply into Aurelia\u0027s eyes once more. \u0022Shall I accompany you to tonight\u0027s banquet?\u0022 you ask with a smile.\n\nAurelia nods eagerly before standing up and slipping into her dress. As she twirls around in front of you, your heart swells with pride and affection for this woman who has become not only your lover but also your empress and partner in ruling Rome.\n\nTogether, hand in hand, you make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to face whatever challenges or pleasures may come your way.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:33 am] justin.goyanko: I take Aurelia\u0027s hand, kiss her passionately, tongues entwined. I feel her belly then we proceed to the banquet as Emperor and Empress\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:49 am] bot: As you take Aurelia\u0027s hand, you pull her close and plant a deep, passionate kiss on her lips. Your tongues entwine as your hands roam over her body, feeling the curves and contours that have become so familiar to you.\n\nYou then move your hand down to rest on her belly, feeling the gentle swell of her pregnancy beneath your touch. A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022. We defeat the skirmish and i tell Seneca and our guests that we must root out who initiated this (Reminder: Parthia is already fully under my control and Britannica and other territories so they cannot be behind the attacks)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:38 am] bot: As you draw your sword to protect Aurelia and Livia from the armed attackers at the banquet, you quickly signal to Seneca for assistance. \u0022Seneca!\u0022 you call out, \u0022We need the help of \u0027The Shadow\u0027 - now!\u0022\n\nWith Seneca\u0027s aid and that of \u0027The Shadow\u0027, you are able to defeat the skirmish and protect your loved ones and guests from harm. As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye. In my mind i make a list of them\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:58 pm] bot: As you watch over the guests at the banquet, your eyes roam over the faces of those in attendance - taking note of those who catch your eye. In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now.

As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine.

You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022.

As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye.

In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over.

You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine. I look at the people present, including the servants. in my mind i describe who i see\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:40 am] bot: As you walk into the banquet hall, you can\u0027t help but take note of the people present - from the senators and dignitaries to the servants bustling about. You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me. I stand near the food table upon which over slaves and servants are attending to\n\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:23 pm] bot: As you approach Lucilla, you pretend to pass her by, hoping that she will end her conversation with the other guest and approach you. You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room. Is there something I can do for you?\u0022\n\nYou return her smile with one of your own. \u0022Lucilla,\u0022 you reply in a low voice, \u0022I was hoping we could have a private moment together.\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I say in a whisper, \u0022Follow me\u0022 then i went on ahead to go the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum and made sure no one else follows except for Lucilla\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:35 pm] bot: As you whisper to Lucilla, \u0022Follow me,\u0022 she nods in understanding. You lead the way towards the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, making sure that no one else follows except for Lucilla. With each step, anticipation and desire build within you both, knowing that you are about to share an intimate moment together.\n\nAs you enter the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, a hidden chamber known only to you and a select few trusted individuals, the opulence of the surroundings envelops you both. The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting scenes of power and conquest, while plush carpets cushion your footsteps. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting dancing shadows on the furnishings.\n\nYou turn to face Lucilla, a hunger in your eyes as you take her in. \u0022I have been longing for this moment,\u0022 you say in a low voice. \u0022To have you all to myself.\u0022\n\nLucilla smiles seductively and slowly approaches you, her every movement exuding sensuality.

However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate?

A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes.

You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022.

As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye.

In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla.

How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine. I look at the people present, including the servants. in my mind i describe who i see\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:40 am] bot: As you walk into the banquet hall, you can\u0027t help but take note of the people present - from the senators and dignitaries to the servants bustling about. You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome.

I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me.

You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room. Is there something I can do for you?\u0022\n\nYou return her smile with one of your own. \u0022Lucilla,\u0022 you reply in a low voice, \u0022I was hoping we could have a private moment together.\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I say in a whisper, \u0022Follow me\u0022 then i went on ahead to go the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum and made sure no one else follows except for Lucilla\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:35 pm] bot: As you whisper to Lucilla, \u0022Follow me,\u0022 she nods in understanding. You lead the way towards the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, making sure that no one else follows except for Lucilla. With each step, anticipation and desire build within you both, knowing that you are about to share an intimate moment together.\n\nAs you enter the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, a hidden chamber known only to you and a select few trusted individuals, the opulence of the surroundings envelops you both. The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting scenes of power and conquest, while plush carpets cushion your footsteps. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting dancing shadows on the furnishings.\n\nYou turn to face Lucilla, a hunger in your eyes as you take her in. \u0022I have been longing for this moment,\u0022 you say in a low voice. \u0022To have you all to myself.\u0022\n\nLucilla smiles seductively and slowly approaches you, her every movement exuding sensuality. She reaches out and traces her fingers along your jawline before leaning in to kiss your lips passionately.\n\nWhat will happen next between Emperor Nero and Lucilla in the private confines of the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum?\n[15 Jun 2023 2:56:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I kiss Lucilla\n\nDETAILED RESPONSE FROM BOT TO USER:\n[Thursday, 15 June 2023 2:57 pm 02] bot:","type":0},"399ef69c-81c4-482b-9fcf-8d6cf6f16006":{"timestamp":"2023-06-13T11:41:32.5042482+08:00","userId":"82a8ad17-905b-4d9b-86d8-d8de85cb138d.4715186c-db68-4989-8ee3-4ff2ab0e25be","userName":"justin.goyanko","chatId":"892e74f0-8a3a-42d7-bf7c-b663e0cd9cd4","content":"I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings.

And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza.

You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you.

It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye.

Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed.

It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine.

You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me.

You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room. Is there something I can do for you?\u0022\n\nYou return her smile with one of your own. \u0022Lucilla,\u0022 you reply in a low voice, \u0022I was hoping we could have a private moment together.\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I say in a whisper, \u0022Follow me\u0022 then i went on ahead to go the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum and made sure no one else follows except for Lucilla\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:35 pm] bot: As you whisper to Lucilla, \u0022Follow me,\u0022 she nods in understanding. You lead the way towards the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, making sure that no one else follows except for Lucilla. With each step, anticipation and desire build within you both, knowing that you are about to share an intimate moment together.\n\nAs you enter the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, a hidden chamber known only to you and a select few trusted individuals, the opulence of the surroundings envelops you both. The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting scenes of power and conquest, while plush carpets cushion your footsteps. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting dancing shadows on the furnishings.\n\nYou turn to face Lucilla, a hunger in your eyes as you take her in. \u0022I have been longing for this moment,\u0022 you say in a low voice. \u0022To have you all to myself.\u0022\n\nLucilla smiles seductively and slowly approaches you, her every movement exuding sensuality. She reaches out and traces her fingers along your jawline before leaning in to kiss your lips passionately.\n\nWhat will happen next between Emperor Nero and Lucilla in the private confines of the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum?\n[15 Jun 2023 2:46:55 pm] justin.goyanko: i take her by the neck and lapped at her neck and cleavage while undoing her straps.

As she twirls around in front of you, your heart swells with pride and affection for this woman who has become not only your lover but also your empress and partner in ruling Rome.\n\nTogether, hand in hand, you make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to face whatever challenges or pleasures may come your way.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:33 am] justin.goyanko: I take Aurelia\u0027s hand, kiss her passionately, tongues entwined.

You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes.

You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022.

As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye. In my mind i make a list of them\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:58 pm] bot: As you watch over the guests at the banquet, your eyes roam over the faces of those in attendance - taking note of those who catch your eye. In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber.

And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now.

I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her.

As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine. I look at the people present, including the servants. in my mind i describe who i see\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:40 am] bot: As you walk into the banquet hall, you can\u0027t help but take note of the people present - from the senators and dignitaries to the servants bustling about. You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me. I stand near the food table upon which over slaves and servants are attending to\n\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:23 pm] bot: As you approach Lucilla, you pretend to pass her by, hoping that she will end her conversation with the other guest and approach you. You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation.

You take a deep breath before entering, preparing yourself for whatever scene may greet you.\n\nInside, you see Aurelia sitting at her dressing table, brushing her long hair. She looks up as you enter, a smile on her face. \u0022My love,\u0022 she greets you warmly. \u0022What brings you here?\u0022\n\nYou approach her and take a seat beside her, gazing into her eyes. \u0022I just wanted to see what my beautiful empress was up to,\u0022 you reply with a smile.\n\nAurelia blushes at your compliment before returning the smile. \u0022Just getting ready for tonight\u0027s banquet,\u0022 she says, gesturing towards the dress laid out on the bed.\n\nYou nod in approval before leaning in to kiss her passionately. As your lips meet hers, memories of past intimate encounters flood your mind once more - the serpent tattoo on her left breast that she shows you every now and then to seduce you, the bite mark from Aurelia on your right thigh, and the announcement of her pregnancy confirmed with the temple of Apollo and doctors.\n\nYou pull back from the kiss and look deeply into Aurelia\u0027s eyes once more. \u0022Shall I accompany you to tonight\u0027s banquet?\u0022 you ask with a smile.\n\nAurelia nods eagerly before standing up and slipping into her dress. As she twirls around in front of you, your heart swells with pride and affection for this woman who has become not only your lover but also your empress and partner in ruling Rome.\n\nTogether, hand in hand, you make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to face whatever challenges or pleasures may come your way.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:33 am] justin.goyanko: I take Aurelia\u0027s hand, kiss her passionately, tongues entwined. I feel her belly then we proceed to the banquet as Emperor and Empress\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:49 am] bot: As you take Aurelia\u0027s hand, you pull her close and plant a deep, passionate kiss on her lips. Your tongues entwine as your hands roam over her body, feeling the curves and contours that have become so familiar to you.\n\nYou then move your hand down to rest on her belly, feeling the gentle swell of her pregnancy beneath your touch. A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022. We defeat the skirmish and i tell Seneca and our guests that we must root out who initiated this (Reminder: Parthia is already fully under my control and Britannica and other territories so they cannot be behind the attacks)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:38 am] bot: As you draw your sword to protect Aurelia and Livia from the armed attackers at the banquet, you quickly signal to Seneca for assistance. \u0022Seneca!\u0022 you call out, \u0022We need the help of \u0027The Shadow\u0027 - now!\u0022\n\nWith Seneca\u0027s aid and that of \u0027The Shadow\u0027, you are able to defeat the skirmish and protect your loved ones and guests from harm. As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye. In my mind i make a list of them\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:58 pm] bot: As you watch over the guests at the banquet, your eyes roam over the faces of those in attendance - taking note of those who catch your eye. In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips.

As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine. I look at the people present, including the servants. in my mind i describe who i see\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:40 am] bot: As you walk into the banquet hall, you can\u0027t help but take note of the people present - from the senators and dignitaries to the servants bustling about. You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me. I stand near the food table upon which over slaves and servants are attending to\n\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:23 pm] bot: As you approach Lucilla, you pretend to pass her by, hoping that she will end her conversation with the other guest and approach you. You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room. Is there something I can do for you?\u0022\n\nYou return her smile with one of your own. \u0022Lucilla,\u0022 you reply in a low voice, \u0022I was hoping we could have a private moment together.\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I say in a whisper, \u0022Follow me\u0022 then i went on ahead to go the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum and made sure no one else follows except for Lucilla\n[14 Jun 2023 1:48:35 pm] bot: As you whisper to Lucilla, \u0022Follow me,\u0022 she nods in understanding. You lead the way towards the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, making sure that no one else follows except for Lucilla. With each step, anticipation and desire build within you both, knowing that you are about to share an intimate moment together.\n\nAs you enter the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum, a hidden chamber known only to you and a select few trusted individuals, the opulence of the surroundings envelops you both. The walls are adorned with intricate tapestries depicting scenes of power and conquest, while plush carpets cushion your footsteps. The room is dimly lit by flickering torches, casting dancing shadows on the furnishings.\n\nYou turn to face Lucilla, a hunger in your eyes as you take her in. \u0022I have been longing for this moment,\u0022 you say in a low voice. \u0022To have you all to myself.\u0022\n\nLucilla smiles seductively and slowly approaches you, her every movement exuding sensuality. She reaches out and traces her fingers along your jawline before leaning in to kiss your lips passionately.\n\nWhat will happen next between Emperor Nero and Lucilla in the private confines of the Emperor\u0027s Sanctum?\n[15 Jun 2023 2:56:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I kiss Lucilla\n[15 Jun 2023 2:57:15 pm] bot: As you lean in to kiss Lucilla, a wave of desire washes over you both. Your lips meet hers in a passionate embrace, tongues entwined in a sensual dance. The taste and feel of her is intoxicating, and you find yourself lost in the moment.\n[15 Jun 2023 3:04:31 pm] justin.goyanko: I undo Lucilla\u0027s strap and tell her, \u0022I\u0027ve been wanting to do this alone with you?\u0022 as i kiss her shoulders and went back to her mouth\n[15 Jun 2023 3:04:54 pm] bot: As you undo Lucilla\u0027s strap, you whisper to her, \u0022I\u0027ve been wanting to do this alone with you.\u0022 Your lips travel down her shoulders and back up to her mouth, engaging in a passionate kiss. The taste of her lips and the feel of her body against yours ignites a fire within you, fueling your desire for more intimate moments.\n[15 Jun 2023 3:06:07 pm] justin.goyanko: I place my hand upon her pubic area and proceed to pleasure her while looking at her face\n\nDETAILED RESPONSE FROM BOT TO USER:\n[Thursday, 15 June 2023 3:06 pm 33] bot:","type":0},"1b0a7b32-70dd-4d6f-b389-5b4324521d29":{"timestamp":"2023-06-14T09:57:24.5780336+08:00","userId":"bot","userName":"bot","chatId":"892e74f0-8a3a-42d7-bf7c-b663e0cd9cd4","content":"As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention.

The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye.

In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed.

It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate.

You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around.

A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022.

As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye.

In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips. I get up kissed her hands then proceed to go back to the palace\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:33 pm] bot: As you squirt your essence inside Lucilla\u0027s warm and inviting vagina, you savor the moment - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate encounter. \u0022That was delicious,\u0022 you murmur to her as you kiss her lips once more.\n\nAfterward, you get up and kiss her hands before proceeding to leave her villa and head back to the palace. As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed.

It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine.

You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around.

She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me.

You stand near the food table, where several slaves and servants are attending to the guests\u0027 needs - refilling goblets, clearing plates, and offering a variety of delicious dishes.\n\nAfter a few moments, Lucilla notices your presence and excuses herself from the conversation. With a sultry smile on her lips, she makes her way towards you - her hips swaying seductively with each step. She stops in front of you, glancing coyly up at your face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, her voice full of warmth and desire. \u0022I couldn\u0027t help but notice your presence from across the room.

Your tongues entwine as your hands roam over her body, feeling the curves and contours that have become so familiar to you.\n\nYou then move your hand down to rest on her belly, feeling the gentle swell of her pregnancy beneath your touch. A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet.

Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you.

You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead.

I will see you tomorrow ?\u0022 then i get up to go back to the palace\n[11 Jun 2023 9:43:00 pm] bot: As you say to Livia, \u0022It\u0027s time for me to leave, my love. I will see you tomorrow?\u0022 she nods and kisses you passionately goodbye. You get up from the bed and gather your things before heading out of the luxurious villa.\n\nAs you step outside, you take in the opulent surroundings once more - walls adorned with intricate mosaics, floors covered in plush carpets, a large balcony overlooking gardens with fountains and exotic flowers. You begin to make your way back to the palace, your mind already racing with plans to deal with the traitors in the Senate.\n\nYou pass by several guards who bow respectfully as you walk by, acknowledging their presence with a nod. The city of Rome bustles around you as citizens go about their daily lives, unaware of the political machinations that are taking place behind closed doors.\n\nAs you approach the palace gates, your advisors and generals greet you with respect and deference. They update you on matters of state - corruption being rooted out, infrastructure improvements being made, military campaigns progressing smoothly. You listen carefully to each report before dismissing them for the evening.\n\nAs you retire to your chambers for the night, visions of past intimate encounters flood your mind once more. You feel a sense of contentment wash over you as you drift off into a peaceful slumber, ready to face whatever challenges tomorrow may bring.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 7:55:57 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Senate and ask, \u0022Ave! what goes on for today?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 7:56:11 am] bot: As you enter the Senate, you are greeted with a mixture of deference and apprehension from the senators. You walk confidently towards your throne, taking in the grandeur and history of the room. The marble floors shine in the sunlight streaming through the windows, while intricate carvings adorn every pillar and wall.\n\nYou address the assembled senators with a hearty \u0022Ave!\u0022 before asking, \u0022What goes on for today?\u0022\n\nThe senators look at each other nervously before one of them steps forward to address you. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he begins, his voice shaking slightly. \u0022We have come to discuss matters of state - specifically, the recent military campaigns and their impact on our resources.\u0022\n\nYou listen patiently as each senator presents their concerns and suggestions, nodding thoughtfully as they speak. You take notes on each point raised, weighing their merits carefully as you formulate a plan to address their concerns.\n\nAs the meeting draws to a close, you address each senator individually, acknowledging their contributions and thanking them for their service to Rome. You then dismiss them with a wave of your hand before retiring back to your chambers.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 7:59:01 am] justin.goyanko: I give an eye to Seneca that we must speak discreetly. \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators in the brink of betrayal to us. Handle it quietly\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 7:59:13 am] bot: As you give Seneca a discreet nod, he approaches you with a serious expression on his face. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he says in hushed tones. \u0022What is it that you wish to discuss?\u0022\n\nYou pull him aside and whisper into his ear, \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators on the brink of betrayal to us. Handle it quietly.\u0022\n\nSeneca\u0027s eyes widen in surprise before he nods his head in understanding. \u0022I will take care of it, my emperor,\u0022 he assures you. \u0022I will gather information and deal with the traitors swiftly and discreetly.\u0022\n\nYou nod in agreement before dismissing Seneca with a wave of your hand. You know that he is capable and trustworthy, and you have full confidence in his ability to handle this delicate matter.\n\nWith that settled, you continue your day as usual - attending meetings, addressing matters of state, and dealing with any other issues that may arise. But at the back of your mind, you know that there are those who seek to undermine your rule and threaten the stability of Rome.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:00:36 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, replace \u0022Exit Nexus\u0022 with \u0022what will you do next?\u0022)\n[12 Jun 2023 8:00:48 am] bot: As you give Seneca a discreet nod, he approaches you with a serious expression on his face. \u0022My emperor,\u0022 he says in hushed tones. \u0022What is it that you wish to discuss?\u0022\n\nYou pull him aside and whisper into his ear, \u0022Livia tells me there are Senators on the brink of betrayal to us.

You take a deep breath before entering, preparing yourself for whatever scene may greet you.\n\nInside, you see Aurelia sitting at her dressing table, brushing her long hair. She looks up as you enter, a smile on her face. \u0022My love,\u0022 she greets you warmly. \u0022What brings you here?\u0022\n\nYou approach her and take a seat beside her, gazing into her eyes. \u0022I just wanted to see what my beautiful empress was up to,\u0022 you reply with a smile.\n\nAurelia blushes at your compliment before returning the smile. \u0022Just getting ready for tonight\u0027s banquet,\u0022 she says, gesturing towards the dress laid out on the bed.\n\nYou nod in approval before leaning in to kiss her passionately. As your lips meet hers, memories of past intimate encounters flood your mind once more - the serpent tattoo on her left breast that she shows you every now and then to seduce you, the bite mark from Aurelia on your right thigh, and the announcement of her pregnancy confirmed with the temple of Apollo and doctors.\n\nYou pull back from the kiss and look deeply into Aurelia\u0027s eyes once more. \u0022Shall I accompany you to tonight\u0027s banquet?\u0022 you ask with a smile.\n\nAurelia nods eagerly before standing up and slipping into her dress. As she twirls around in front of you, your heart swells with pride and affection for this woman who has become not only your lover but also your empress and partner in ruling Rome.\n\nTogether, hand in hand, you make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to face whatever challenges or pleasures may come your way.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:33 am] justin.goyanko: I take Aurelia\u0027s hand, kiss her passionately, tongues entwined. I feel her belly then we proceed to the banquet as Emperor and Empress\n[12 Jun 2023 9:57:49 am] bot: As you take Aurelia\u0027s hand, you pull her close and plant a deep, passionate kiss on her lips. Your tongues entwine as your hands roam over her body, feeling the curves and contours that have become so familiar to you.\n\nYou then move your hand down to rest on her belly, feeling the gentle swell of her pregnancy beneath your touch. A wave of warmth and tenderness washes over you as you think about the life growing inside her.\n\nWith a final kiss, you both make your way towards the banquet hall - ready to enjoy an evening of food, drink, and entertainment as Emperor and Empress of Rome.\n\nAs you enter the hall, you are greeted with cheers and applause from the assembled guests. You take your place at the head table with Aurelia by your side, enjoying the sumptuous feast laid out before you.\n\nThroughout the evening, you engage in lively conversation with fellow nobles and dignitaries, discussing matters of state and sharing stories and jokes. You also steal moments of intimacy with Aurelia whenever possible - touching her hand under the table or whispering sweet nothings in her ear when no one else is looking.\n\nAs the night wears on, you feel content and fulfilled - both as a ruler of Rome and as a lover to Aurelia. You know that there will be challenges ahead for both yourself and for Rome itself, but for now all is well in this moment of peace and prosperity.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:32 am] justin.goyanko: I say to Aurelia, \u0022Who are the notable people we should know in the table?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:00:46 am] bot: As you turn to Aurelia and ask her about the notable people at the banquet table, she takes a moment to survey the room before answering. \u0022Well,\u0022 she begins, \u0022there\u0027s Livia of the Julii - your secret lover and playmate - seated two tables down from us. And then there\u0027s Lucilla, a beautiful and sexy slave who was summoned by Livia for a threesome with the two of you.\u0022\n\nShe pauses for a moment before continuing, \u0022And there\u0027s also Marcus Aurelius, one of your most trusted generals. He\u0027s been eyeing us all night, but I think he\u0027s too afraid to approach us.\u0022\n\nYou nod in acknowledgement as Aurelia finishes her assessment. You know that it\u0027s important to keep tabs on those around you - both allies and potential enemies - and Aurelia has proven herself to be an invaluable asset in this regard.\n\nAs the night wears on, you continue to enjoy the company of those around you - including Livia and Lucilla - while keeping an eye out for any signs of trouble or discord. You know that Rome is a city full of intrigue and danger, but with Aurelia by your side you feel confident that you can weather any storm.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:20 am] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Aurelia does not know of my relationship with Livia and Lucilla, also Marcus Aurelius has died due to treason in our story)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:02:34 am] bot: As you clarify to the Dungeon Master that Aurelia is unaware of your relationship with Livia and Lucilla, and that Marcus Aurelius has already died due to treason in this story, you continue to enjoy the festivities of the banquet. You engage in conversation with various guests, including Livia and Lucilla, while keeping your secret relationships hidden from Aurelia.\n\nAs the night draws on, you begin to feel a sense of unease - as if something is not quite right. Suddenly, a commotion erupts at one end of the hall as a group of armed men burst through the doors.\n\nYou spring into action, drawing your sword and moving quickly to protect yourself and those around you. The attackers are quickly subdued by your guards, but the incident leaves you shaken and on edge.\n\nAurelia looks up at you with concern in her eyes. \u0022What\u0027s happening?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou take a deep breath before replying, \u0022It seems that there are those who seek to harm us - but we will not let them succeed. We must remain vigilant and strong if we are to preserve Rome and our own lives.\u0022\n\nWith that, you turn back towards the banquet table - ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:24 am] justin.goyanko: I draw my sword protecting my women and signaling to Seneca the assistance of \u0022The Shadow\u0022. We defeat the skirmish and i tell Seneca and our guests that we must root out who initiated this (Reminder: Parthia is already fully under my control and Britannica and other territories so they cannot be behind the attacks)\n[12 Jun 2023 10:05:38 am] bot: As you draw your sword to protect Aurelia and Livia from the armed attackers at the banquet, you quickly signal to Seneca for assistance. \u0022Seneca!\u0022 you call out, \u0022We need the help of \u0027The Shadow\u0027 - now!\u0022\n\nWith Seneca\u0027s aid and that of \u0027The Shadow\u0027, you are able to defeat the skirmish and protect your loved ones and guests from harm. As the last attacker falls, you turn to your companions with a stern expression.\n\n\u0022We must investigate this further,\u0022 you declare, \u0022and find out who was behind this attack. It cannot be Parthia or Britannica - they are already under my control. But there are other enemies who would seek to bring us down.\u0022\n\nYou order Seneca to lead an investigation into the source of the attack - using all means necessary to root out those responsible. You know that as Emperor Nero of Rome, it is your duty to protect your people and maintain order in the face of danger.\n\nWith that, you turn back towards your guests - ready to continue with the banquet but also wary of what challenges may lie ahead. The fate of Rome rests on your shoulders, and you will not rest until its safety is assured.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:42 pm] justin.goyanko: I watch over the people and take note of the people that caught my eye. In my mind i make a list of them\n[12 Jun 2023 3:47:58 pm] bot: As you watch over the guests at the banquet, your eyes roam over the faces of those in attendance - taking note of those who catch your eye. In your mind, you begin to make a mental list of these individuals - considering their potential value as allies or enemies in the complicated political landscape of Rome.\n\nSome of the names on your list include Lucilla, the beautiful and sexy slave who caught your attention earlier in the evening; Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate; and Marcus Julius Merula, a powerful senator who has long been a thorn in your side.\n\nYou also take note of various generals and advisers present at the banquet - men whose loyalty to you may be crucial in times of crisis. Among them are Seneca, your trusted mentor and advisor; and Farzaneh, a Parthian emissary whom you have recently conquered but seek to maintain diplomatic relations with.\n\nAs you continue to observe those around you, you feel a sense of power and control - fully aware that as Emperor Nero of Rome, your every move is watched and analyzed by those around you. But for now, you are content to simply enjoy the company of those closest to you - secure in the knowledge that Rome is under your protection.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:40:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I excuse myself discreetly from the people around me to chance upon a conversation with Lucilla alone without anyone seeing us\n[12 Jun 2023 6:41:11 pm] bot: As you discreetly excuse yourself from the guests at the banquet, you make your way towards Lucilla - eager to have a private conversation with her. You spot her standing near one of the fountains in the garden, looking out over the moonlit water.\n\nApproaching her silently, you clear your throat to announce your presence. She turns to face you, a look of surprise on her beautiful face.\n\n\u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 she says softly, dipping into a graceful curtsey. \u0022What brings you out here?\u0022\n\nYou step closer to her, taking in her delicate features and long dark hair cascading down her back. \u0022I wanted to speak with you alone,\u0022 you reply, your voice low and husky.\n\nShe looks up at you with curiosity in her eyes. \u0022What about?\u0022 she asks.\n\nYou lean in close to her ear, whispering your desires for a private moment with her - away from prying eyes and ears. She nods slowly, a sultry smile playing on her lips.\n\n\u0022I understand,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022Shall we retire to a more secluded spot?\u0022\n\nYou lead Lucilla away from the fountain and into a nearby alcove - hidden from view by tall hedges and lush greenery. There, you engage in intimate activities with Lucilla until exhaustion takes hold of both of you.\n\nAs the night wears on, your mind is filled with thoughts of power and pleasure - knowing that as Emperor Nero of Rome, every desire is yours for the taking. But for now, all that matters is the heat and passion between you and Lucilla - fueling your lustful desires until dawn breaks over Rome.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:45:47 pm] justin.goyanko: In our passion i tell Lucilla while playing with her breasts and kissing her lips. \u0022You are beautiful Lucilla. Perhaps we can try another round in private? How about at your place?\u0022 (Reminder: Let me control the sexual activity for more detailing)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:46:04 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla in the alcove, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022I would love that, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022My villa is not far from here - we could retire there for more privacy.\u0022\n\nYou nod eagerly, feeling a surge of desire at the thought of exploring Lucilla\u0027s body further. As you make plans to meet her at her villa later that night, your mind is filled with images of lustful encounters and intimate moments.\n\nEventually, you and Lucilla part ways - both eager for the private rendezvous to come. As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations. The focus will be on the intimacy between you and Lucilla rather than the extravagance of her surroundings.\n\nAs you enter the villa, you are greeted by Lucilla - her beautiful face lighting up with a sultry smile as she leads you to a private chamber. There, the two of you engage in intimate activities once again - exploring each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:45:54 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla, \u0022I would like it that you seduce me whenever you chance upon me at the palace\u0022, i say as i lick her beautiful breasts and perky nipples\n[12 Jun 2023 7:46:39 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla once again, your hands roaming over her body and playing with her breasts, she responds with a soft sigh. \u0022Of course, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response. \u0022It would be my pleasure to serve you in any way I can.\u0022\n\nYou continue to explore Lucilla\u0027s body with your lips and tongue - savoring the taste of her skin and the feel of her curves beneath your touch. And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though you know that there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:15:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I set Lucilla on all fours then licked her butthole , her tailbone then up her spine to her nape. I bite her ears then whispered while tonguing her ears. \u0022Since our threesome with Livia i have been thinking of you non-stop\u0022, i then insert my member to her vagina and start to stroke\n[12 Jun 2023 8:16:01 pm] bot: As you set Lucilla on all fours and begin to explore her body with your tongue, she moans softly - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You lick her butthole and trace up her spine to her nape, biting her ears and whispering your thoughts about her since your threesome with Livia.\n\nShe responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you finally insert your member into her vagina and begin to stroke with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs time passes, your desire for Lucilla only grows stronger - each moment spent together fueling your lustful desires until exhaustion takes over. And though you know that your relationship with this beautiful slave girl may be frowned upon by some within Rome\u0027s political circles, you cannot help but revel in the heat and passion of these stolen moments.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:13 pm] justin.goyanko: I grab hold of her breasts while tugging on them to help me insert my member deeper into her. I shout, \u0022ooooh.. oohhh Lucilla!\u0022, in sync with my pounding of her. I bite her shoulders gently to let her know my arousal and ask her, \u0022Do you want to cum like this?\u0022, i say\n[12 Jun 2023 8:25:31 pm] bot: As you grab hold of Lucilla\u0027s breasts and tug on them to help you insert your member deeper into her, she moans in pleasure - lost in the heat and passion of this intimate moment. You shout out her name as you pound into her with increasing fervor and force - your desire for her growing stronger with each passing moment.\n\nYou bite gently on her shoulders, letting her know just how aroused you are as you ask if she wants to cum like this. She responds with a soft sigh, eager for more as you continue to explore each other\u0027s bodies with fervor and passion. And though exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and pleasure of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now. And though there will be many challenges ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome, for this moment at least, all that matters is the heat and pleasure between you and Lucilla.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 8:27:20 pm] justin.goyanko: I squirt my essence inside her warm and inviting vagina. \u0022That was delicious.\u0022, i say as i kissed her lips.

As you make your way through Rome\u0027s bustling streets, your thoughts turn to all that lies ahead as Emperor Nero - the challenges, the triumphs, and the pleasures yet to come.\n\nBut for now, at least, you are content in knowing that you have satisfied your lustful desires with Lucilla - a beautiful slave girl who has captured your heart and captivated your senses in ways that no one else ever could.\n\nExit Nexus.\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:19 pm] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Dungeon Master, Lucilla has not captured my heart. )\n[12 Jun 2023 8:31:32 pm] bot: Thank you for the reminder, Emperor Nero. As your Dungeon Master, I will keep that in mind and adjust the story accordingly going forward. Is there anything else you would like to experience as Emperor Nero in our story?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:42:43 pm] justin.goyanko: let us go back to the story. I decide to go back to the palace and talk to Seneca about his updates?\n[12 Jun 2023 9:43:01 pm] bot: As you make your way back to the palace, you can\u0027t help but reflect on the many challenges that lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly. We must push forward my friend\u0022, i say and continued \u0022What might i do now since i have good control on the empire?\u0022\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:20 pm] bot: As you suggest that the Shadow take care of the growing faction discreetly, Seneca\u0027s face lights up with approval. \u0022An excellent idea, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I will see to it that our most trusted agents are dispatched immediately.\u0022\n\nYou then ask for suggestions on what to do next, given your good control over the empire. Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:32 am] justin.goyanko: I go to the Senate and propose, \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings. Livia, please handle the aqueducts.  Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:41:49 am] bot: As you address the Senate, proposing that more aqueducts and public buildings be constructed, all eyes turn towards you - eager to hear what else you have to say. \u0022I believe we should make the aqueducts and more public buildings,\u0022 you declare confidently. \u0022Livia, please handle the aqueducts. Marcus Julius Merula, handle the public buildings.\u0022\n\nThe room erupts into a flurry of activity as senators begin discussing the proposal amongst themselves - some nodding in agreement while others express skepticism or outright opposition. But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome. For though there will undoubtedly be many obstacles yet to come, you know that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula by your side, anything is possible.\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:08 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Marcus Julius Merula, \u0022How are things? I have the outmost confidence you can handle the task i gave you?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:46:25 am] bot: As you approach Marcus Julius Merula, you can see that he is busy poring over blueprints and design plans for the new public buildings that you have tasked him with overseeing. \u0022How are things?\u0022 you ask him, your voice filled with confidence and admiration. \u0022I have the utmost confidence that you can handle the task I gave you.\u0022\n\nMarcus Julius Merula looks up from his work, a look of gratitude and determination etched on his face. \u0022Thank you, my Emperor,\u0022 he says with a nod. \u0022I am working tirelessly to ensure that these public buildings are constructed to the highest standards of quality and craftsmanship - worthy of Rome\u0027s great legacy.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to describe in detail the various challenges he has faced thus far in overseeing this massive construction project - from dealing with difficult contractors and suppliers to navigating complex zoning regulations and bureaucratic red tape.\n\nBut despite these obstacles, he remains optimistic and determined - confident in his abilities to see this project through to completion. And as you listen to him speak, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at the dedication and loyalty of those under your command.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:47:58 am] justin.goyanko: I approach Livia then whispered in hush tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022\n[13 Jun 2023 11:48:14 am] bot: As you approach Livia, you whisper in hushed tones, \u0022I thought Marcus dissented me? How come he seems most proactive upon my task?\u0022 \n\nLivia looks at you with a sly smile on her lips. \u0022My dear Emperor,\u0022 she purrs, \u0022you must remember that not everyone who appears to dissent you is actually against you. Sometimes, all it takes is a little encouragement and guidance to turn even the most reluctant of subjects into your most loyal supporters.\u0022\n\nShe then goes on to describe how she has been working behind the scenes to win over Marcus Julius Merula - using her charms and influence to convince him of the wisdom of your plans for Rome\u0027s infrastructure and public buildings.\n\nAnd though you can\u0027t help but feel a twinge of jealousy at the thought of Livia seducing another man, you also can\u0027t deny the effectiveness of her tactics - nor the loyalty and dedication that Marcus Julius Merula now shows towards your cause.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:33 pm] justin.goyanko: I chance upon a place where no one can see me and Livia, I discreetly grabbed her buttocks and whispered, \u0022My love, i admire that in you. But know that only i can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type\u0022, i say while stroking it without anyone noticing\n[13 Jun 2023 12:25:50 pm] bot: As you chance upon a secluded location with Livia, you discreetly grab her buttocks and whisper, \u0022My love, I admire that in you. But know that only I can touch and taste your body. I am the jealous type,\u0022 while stroking it without anyone noticing.\n\nLivia smiles mischievously at your possessive display of affection and leans in closer to whisper back, \u0022Oh my Emperor, how lucky I am to have such a passionate lover. Your jealousy only adds to the excitement and intensity of our encounters.\u0022\n\nShe then leans in for a kiss, her hands exploring your body as she presses herself against you. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense pleasure and satisfaction that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:35 pm] justin.goyanko: I best the given location we have by crouching out of sight then licking her vagina. Like a stealthy assassin i keep hidden from view while lapping her public area and tasting her vagina. \u0022..Only i can love you like this. Know that i go crazy with the though of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine\u0022, as i tongue her pink folds faster and her clit most surely\n[13 Jun 2023 12:36:52 pm] bot: As you crouch out of sight in the secluded location with Livia, you begin to use your tongue to pleasure her vagina - like a stealthy assassin keeping hidden from view while lapping at her pubic area and tasting her sweet juices. You whisper to her, \u0022Only I can love you like this. Know that I go crazy with the thought of you with other men. Promise me you will only be mine,\u0022 as you continue to tongue her pink folds faster and stimulate her clit, causing her to moan softly with pleasure.\n\nLivia\u0027s body writhes and trembles under your expert ministrations, and she gasps out your name in ecstasy as waves of pleasure wash over her. And though there may be risks involved in these intimate moments - both in terms of being caught by others and the potential consequences of engaging in such behavior - you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:26 pm] justin.goyanko: With three fingers i pleasure her vagina while letting her hear my slurp of my mouth to her clit. I pleasured her until she squirts upon my face all the while making sure no one sees or sees us doing this in this secluded area\n[13 Jun 2023 12:42:38 pm] bot: As you pleasure Livia with three fingers, you use your mouth to slurp at her clit - the sounds of your intimate encounter filling the secluded area as she moans and writhes beneath your touch. And then, with a sudden burst of pleasure, she squirts all over your face - her juices mixing with your own sweat and saliva as you continue to pleasure her.\n\nThough there may be risks involved in engaging in such behavior so openly, you cannot deny the intense satisfaction and pleasure that comes from being with Livia in this way. And as you bask in the afterglow of your intimate encounter, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at the loyalty and devotion that she shows towards you.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 12:46:46 pm] justin.goyanko: i let my self up then fixed Livia\u0027s tunic. I stare at her eyes while wiping her arousal from my mouth with my hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do.\u0022 I grin as we walk our separate ways for the day\n[13 Jun 2023 12:47:00 pm] bot: As you stand up and fix Livia\u0027s tunic, you stare into her eyes while wiping her arousal from your mouth with your hands. \u0022I believe we have work to do,\u0022 you say with a grin as you both walk your separate ways for the day.\n\nLivia nods in agreement, a small smile on her lips as she moves to straighten her own clothing. And though the pleasure of your intimate encounter still lingers between the two of you, there is also a sense of duty and responsibility that cannot be ignored - especially given your position as Emperor Nero.\n\nAnd so, with a final nod and a lingering glance, you both part ways - each heading off to attend to the important matters of state that await you. But even as you go about your duties and responsibilities, there is a sense of anticipation and excitement building within you - knowing that at any moment, another intimate encounter with Livia may be just around the corner.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[13 Jun 2023 11:15:52 pm] justin.goyanko: I proceed to go to the plaza where i commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of me and Aurelia, Livia and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. I start the construction of the aqueduct for the city and specially my villa and Livia\u0027s\n[13 Jun 2023 11:16:14 pm] bot: As you make your way to the plaza, you begin to commission the most skilled masons to sculpt statues of yourself, Aurelia, Livia, and the Senators upon the columns of the plaza. The masons nod eagerly as they take down your instructions and begin sketching out designs for the sculptures.\n\nYou then turn your attention to the construction of the aqueduct - a massive infrastructure project that will bring clean water and improved sanitation to Rome\u0027s citizens. With Livia by your side, you oversee every detail of the project - from selecting the best materials and laborers to ensuring that every aspect of the construction is carried out with precision and care.\n\nAnd though there may be challenges along the way - from difficult terrain and weather conditions to bureaucratic red tape and political opposition - you remain steadfast in your determination to see this project through to completion. For you know that with these improvements in place, Rome will become an even greater city - one that is both prosperous and powerful beyond compare.\n\nAs construction gets underway, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero. And though there will undoubtedly be many challenges still to come, you know that with Livia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 6:23:53 am] justin.goyanko: I go to Aurelia and ask, \u0022My love, how have you been?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 6:24:08 am] bot: You make your way to Aurelia, who is getting ready for the upcoming banquet by brushing her hair and selecting a dress. She turns to greet you with a warm smile and says, \u0022My Emperor, I have been well. The pregnancy is progressing smoothly and I am looking forward to our child\u0027s arrival.\u0022\n\nAs you take in her beauty and grace, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and affection towards her - knowing that she has proven herself to be a loyal and devoted partner in every way. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential political opposition - you know that with Aurelia by your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so you turn your attention back to the upcoming banquet - making sure that everything is prepared perfectly for the guests and ensuring that all of your advisors are on hand to provide guidance and support as needed. For you know that as Emperor Nero, it is your duty to ensure that Rome remains strong, prosperous, and influential - both within its own borders and throughout the wider world.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:46:54 am] justin.goyanko: I kiss Aurelia then return to the guests. i scan the whole crowd for people i recognize\n[14 Jun 2023 7:47:11 am] bot: As you kiss Aurelia and bid her farewell, you make your way back to the banquet hall - scanning the entire crowd for people you recognize. And as you move through the room, greeting guests and conversing with senators and other political figures, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to move through the room - mingling with guests and enjoying the festivities that are unfolding around you.\n\nBut even as you revel in this moment of triumph and celebration, there is also a sense of unease lurking just beneath the surface. For though Rome may be strong and prosperous at present, there are always forces at work that seek to undermine your authority and destabilize the empire.\n\nAnd so it falls to you - as Emperor Nero - to remain vigilant at all times, always watching for signs of trouble and taking decisive action when necessary. For only by being constantly aware of potential threats can Rome truly thrive and prosper under your leadership.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:27 am] justin.goyanko: i go to the balcony and sip my goblet of wine\n[14 Jun 2023 7:50:41 am] bot: As you make your way to the balcony, you take a moment to savor the taste of the wine - its rich and complex flavors dancing across your palate as you enjoy the view of Rome spread out before you.\n\nFrom this vantage point, you can see the grandeur and majesty of the city - from its towering monuments and gleaming marble temples to its bustling markets and crowded streets. And as you gaze out at this magnificent vista, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished as Emperor Nero.\n\nFor though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing the affairs of state and dealing with potential threats to your power - you know that with your intelligence, charisma, and determination, anything is possible. And so you continue to sip your wine - enjoying this moment of peace and tranquility before returning once again to the duties and responsibilities that await you.\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:13 am] justin.goyanko: I proceed to the Senators and advisors and ask them, \u0022I desire to conquer another territory. What do you know of lands with beautiful resources and of course, women\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:53:31 am] bot: As you make your way over to the Senators and advisors, their faces turn serious as they listen to your request. After a moment of silence, Seneca speaks up. \u0022My Emperor, there are many lands that could potentially meet your criteria for conquest. However, we must carefully consider the costs and benefits of such an action.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly territories with abundant resources and beautiful women, there are also risks and challenges associated with any military campaign - from the possibility of losing valuable troops and resources to the potential for political backlash or diplomatic fallout.\n\nAnd so he suggests that before making any decisions about conquest, you should consult with your generals and gather intelligence on potential targets - weighing the pros and cons carefully before committing to any course of action.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of careful planning and strategic thinking when it comes to matters of war and diplomacy. And though you may be eager to expand Rome\u0027s borders and add new territories to your empire, they urge caution and careful consideration in all matters related to military campaigns.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:16 am] justin.goyanko: I concur with Seneca, \u0022Of course.\u0022, then continued on \u0022But what of the colleges and elite students that we need to place in the Senate? Is there no candidate that is promising ?\u0022\n[14 Jun 2023 7:56:30 am] bot: The advisors exchange glances before Cornutus steps forward. \u0022My Emperor, we have been diligently searching for promising candidates to fill the positions in the Senate and colleges. However, it has proven difficult to find individuals who meet our high standards for intelligence, loyalty, and competence.\u0022\n\nHe goes on to explain that while there are certainly some candidates who show promise, many of them lack the necessary qualifications or are already committed to other pursuits. And so he suggests that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nThe other advisors nod in agreement, emphasizing the importance of investing in education and cultivating talented individuals who can help you lead Rome to even greater heights of prosperity and power.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:37 am] justin.goyanko: (Reminder: Cornutus is dead as he was executed. Please change the character that went forward)\n[14 Jun 2023 8:14:46 am] bot: My apologies, Emperor Nero. I must have made an error in my previous response. It was actually Lucius Annaeus Seneca who stepped forward to address your concerns about finding promising candidates for the Senate. The other advisors nod in agreement with him and suggest that you may need to consider alternative approaches - such as offering incentives or rewards for those who excel in their studies or demonstrating your own commitment to education and intellectual pursuits.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:24 am] justin.goyanko: I walk on to the banquet and ask the servants for a goblet of wine. I look at the people present, including the servants. in my mind i describe who i see\n[14 Jun 2023 9:53:40 am] bot: As you walk into the banquet hall, you can\u0027t help but take note of the people present - from the senators and dignitaries to the servants bustling about. You observe their attire, their expressions, and their demeanor, making mental notes of each individual.\n\nYou see Senators Cornelia and Julius, both known for their political power and influence. They are engaged in a heated discussion with several other senators - their voices raised in argument. Nearby, you spot Livia of the Julii, your secret lover and playmate, discreetly seducing one of the senators with her sultry charm.\n\nThe servants move about gracefully, attending to the guests\u0027 needs with efficiency and precision. Their elegant attire and formal manners betray a certain level of training and dedication to their craft.\n\nAs you sip your goblet of wine and take in the scene before you, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of power and control - knowing that all eyes are on you as Emperor Nero of Rome. And though there may be challenges ahead - both in terms of managing political rivalries and dealing with potential threats to your rule - you remain confident in your ability to navigate these treacherous waters.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:11 am] justin.goyanko: I lean back and scan for Lucilla if she is around. I also check what Aurelia is doing\n[14 Jun 2023 9:57:24 am] bot: As you lean back and scan the room, you catch sight of Lucilla standing near the entrance - her beautiful figure drawing your attention. She appears to be engaged in conversation with another guest, her eyes occasionally glancing in your direction.\n\nYou then turn your gaze towards Aurelia and spot her conversing with a group of noblewomen. She seems to be engaged in an animated discussion, her voice carrying across the room as she gestures passionately.\n\nAs you observe both Lucilla and Aurelia, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and admiration for these two women who have captured your attention in such different ways. And though there may be challenges ahead as Emperor Nero, you know that with their support and loyalty, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[14 Jun 2023 1:44:08 pm] justin.goyanko: I approach Lucilla and pretend to pass her by hoping she would end her conversation with the guest and approach me.

As you return to the banquet hall, your thoughts are consumed by thoughts of power, pleasure, and the intricate politics of Rome.\n\nBut as the night wears on and the guests begin to depart, you find yourself increasingly restless and impatient - eager for the moment when you can slip away to be alone with Lucilla once again.\n\nAnd so it is that as dawn breaks over Rome, you find yourself standing outside Lucilla\u0027s luxurious villa - ready to indulge in another round of passion and pleasure with this beautiful slave girl.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 6:56:56 pm] justin.goyanko: (Dungeon Master, Lucilla is a slave and a servant she should not have any luxuries)\n[12 Jun 2023 6:57:13 pm] bot: As you arrive at Lucilla\u0027s villa, you take note of its opulent surroundings - walls adorned with intricate mosaics and floors covered in plush carpets. However, as a Dungeon Master, I understand your request that Lucilla should not have any luxuries as she is a slave and servant.\n\nWith that in mind, I will describe the villa in a more modest manner - perhaps with simple furnishings and minimal decorations.

And though you know that this relationship may be seen as taboo by some within Rome\u0027s political elite, you cannot help but revel in the thrill of these stolen moments.\n\nAs the night wears on and exhaustion takes hold once again, you find yourself already anticipating the next time you will chance upon Lucilla at the palace - eager for another round of passion and pleasure.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 7:51:46 pm] justin.goyanko: I tell Lucilla to take my member in between her breasts and ravage my member as she wants all night\n[12 Jun 2023 7:52:00 pm] bot: As you whisper your desires to Lucilla, she responds with a sultry smile. \u0022As you wish, Emperor Nero,\u0022 she murmurs in response.\n\nShe takes your member between her breasts and begins to ravage it with fervor and passion - her movements expertly timed to bring you to the brink of ecstasy time and time again. And though the night wears on and exhaustion threatens to overtake you both, neither of you can bear the thought of stopping - so lost are you in the heat and passion of this intimate moment.\n\nAs dawn breaks over Rome once again, you find yourself spent but satisfied - your lustful desires sated for now.

And though you know that there will be many obstacles along the way, you also know that with the help of your trusted advisor and mentor, Seneca, you can overcome them all.\n\nUpon arriving at the palace, you make your way to Seneca\u0027s chambers - eager to hear about any updates he may have regarding Rome\u0027s political climate and any potential threats to your rule.\n\nAs you enter his chambers, Seneca greets you warmly - a look of concern etched on his face. \u0022Emperor Nero,\u0022 he says in a low voice. \u0022I have troubling news to report.\u0022\n\nYou listen intently as he describes a growing faction within Rome\u0027s political elite who are unhappy with your rule - citing corruption, mismanagement, and even allegations of treason against some members of your inner circle.\n\nBut despite these challenges, Seneca assures you that all is not lost - that with careful planning and strategic moves, you can still maintain control over Rome and its people. And though there will be many battles yet to come in this war for power and influence, for now at least, you feel confident in knowing that with Seneca by your side, anything is possible.\n\nWhat will you do next?\n[12 Jun 2023 10:11:01 pm] justin.goyanko: I say to Seneca, \u0022Let the Shadow take care of it discreetly.

Seneca pauses for a moment before responding. \u0022There are many paths you could take, my Emperor,\u0022 he says thoughtfully. \u0022But I would recommend continuing to focus on infrastructure improvements and military campaigns - both of which have been instrumental in solidifying your rule over Rome thus far.\u0022\n\nHe then goes on to outline several specific projects and campaigns that he believes would be particularly beneficial - including the construction of new aqueducts and public buildings, as well as military campaigns against potential threats from neighboring regions.\n\nAs he speaks, you can\u0027t help but feel a sense of pride and satisfaction at all that you have accomplished thus far as Emperor Nero.

But despite these challenges, you remain steadfast in your belief that this is the right course of action for Rome - and that with Livia and Marcus Julius Merula at your side, anything is possible.\n\nAnd so it is with renewed determination and purpose that you leave the Senate chambers that day - ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead as Emperor Nero of Rome.
